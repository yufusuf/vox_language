metu-ceng444 phase 2 of implementing vox

# details about my implementation:
<ul>
<li>
almost everything implemented except vectors
</li>
<li>
lib_vox.c is looking a bit weird because, i started the intention with runtime checks for vectors and integers, but
i didnt have enough time
</li>
<li>
i didnt implement string literals on variables
</li>
<li>
almost everything other than that should work
</li>
</ul>

# compilation
- to compile: run compile.py with "file_name" it should generate an assembly file called "asm_vox.s"
- --show_il argument shows the il generated on console 
- i put 2 sample programs which shows many of the thins i have implemented
